      <h2>More about me</h2>
      <br><p>Hi! I’m Cheng Hsuan, a student at ACS (Barker Road) passionate about technology, systems thinking, and hands-on innovation. My interests lie at the intersection of hardware and cybersecurity, where I enjoy building, analysing, and improving systems to understand how they work.</p><br>

     <br><p>I’ve actively participated in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions such as Hack@AC, YES BUT NO, and Blahaj CTF, sharpening my digital problem-solving, logical reasoning, and teamwork skills. These challenges deepen my insight into real-world cybersecurity and fuel my drive to pursue the field.</p><br>

    <br><p>As a two-time Class Monitor and leadership module graduate, I’ve honed strong communication and team coordination abilities, often bridging peers and educators during projects. I thrive under pressure while staying organized and focused on achieving goals.</p><br>

    <br><p>Outside tech, I’m a hobbyist who enjoys nature photography—especially birding trips with relatives, where I’ve cultivated patience. I also love customizing mechanical keyboards, blending hardware tweaking with design, and unwinding to jazz music. I’m always experimenting with ideas that stretch both my creativity and technical skills.</p><br>

<br><p>Driven by curiosity and a passion for growth, I’m eager to take on new challenges that push me further in cybersecurity, technology, and beyond.</p><br>

      <ul>
        <li>4th place in SP YCEP(2025)<img src="https://assets.isu.pub/document-structure/241118063345-0056ab2f1ef3cde4fabc8386082665cc/v1/9ada4c52bd57d5d8ebdeccb220a47f64.jpeg" alt="Python" width="20" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;"></li>
        <br><p>This ctf was one of the ctfs which i had quite a bit of fun in, some of the challenges were quite hard, while some took much patience in order to solve. For example, one of the web inspector challenges, although i originally perceived as quite easy, i had not anticipated it to be so tedious. With the flag being split into 6 parts, it took me quite a bit in order to find all the parts. Leading me to first blooding the challenge.</p></br>

        <li>15th place in CCTF(individual)<img src="https://cyberrange-sec.ciscoctf.io/static/images/ciscologo-dark.svg" alt="Python" width="20" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;"></li>
        <br><p>Although the competition was stiff and the challenges being relatively hard, i still got 13th place through forensic challenges, finding the hidden code and using it to decrypt the flag that was also hidden in the wireshark .pcap file.</p></br>

        <li>12th in BlahajCTF<img src="https://ctftime.org/media/team/blahaj2.png" alt="Python" width="20" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;"></li>
        <br><p>One of the most memorable challenges that i had in this ctf was the finding xiao ming series of challenges, where we had to find a fictional character called xiao ming who was unable to locate where he was from. Through a series of challenges, we were supposed to find where he lived by triangulating 3 locations all around Singapore. Through this ctf, i also learned of the various ways to find locations.</p></br>
        <li>17th place in SP YCEP(2024)<img src="https://assets.isu.pub/document-structure/241118063345-0056ab2f1ef3cde4fabc8386082665cc/v1/9ada4c52bd57d5d8ebdeccb220a47f64.jpeg" alt="Python" width="20" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;"></li>
        <br><p>This being one of my first ctfs, i was unsure on how to use the tools that was provided. Even with the training course that was provided. I learnt the most during the competition, learning about the various ways to make use of google lens for the Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) challenges, finally ending up in 17th place through the learning i had done during the competition.</p></br>
        <li>9th place in CCTF(group)<img src="https://cyberrange-sec.ciscoctf.io/static/images/ciscologo-dark.svg" alt="Python" width="20" style="vertical-align: middle; margin-right: 8px;"></li>

        <h3>Pwnagotchi</h3>
        <p>A Pwangotchi is a tool that utilizes bettercap and operates on a Raspberry Pi to monitor its surrounding Wi-Fi environment, aiming to capture crackable WPA key material. It collects this data by passively sniffing. The captured material is stored on disk as PCAP files, which include various handshakes supported by hashcat, such as full and half WPA handshakes and PMKIDs.</p>
        <br><p>After having to research where to find the different components, due to having a limited budget and some components like the Pisugar 3 not shipping to Singapore because of logistical issus and combing through Singaporean law on  in order to make this legal, having to disable deauth</p></br>
